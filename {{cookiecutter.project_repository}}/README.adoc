== Requirements for development

This tools are language agnostic and don't belong to a single project.
Install them locally for your user or globally for your system.

- https://www.gnu.org/software/make/[GNU Make] for workflow automation
- https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit[pre-commit] for Git hooks
- https://github.com/andreoliwa/nitpick[Nitpick] for project configuration management
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] for Python version management

NOTE: I recommend https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx[pipx] for Python application management, but it is not required for this project.
