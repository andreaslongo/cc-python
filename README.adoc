== Dependency Management (draft)

----
python-project/
| requirements-dev.in
| requirements-dev.txt
| requirements.in
| requirements.txt
----

The `.in` files are dependencies and the `.txt` files are the pinned and hashed results of `pip-compile`.

.Example
- https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/tree/master/requirements


IMPORTANT: `pip-compile` has no proper resolver.
It has to run under the *same Python version as the project itâ€™s locking and in the same environment*, or else conditional dependencies will not work correctly.
